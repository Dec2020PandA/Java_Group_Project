Thrift Buddy

The idea for this website is to have a resource to quickly allow users to compare prices on used
items (i.e. items you would come across while thrift shopping) to see if they are a fair price.

 ---- MVP Features ----
   - Login / Registration 
   
   - eBay API integration - the website will present the user with eBay postings of 
	the object they are searching for to help give them an idea of the object's value.
	this data will be processed and give the user an estimated good, fair, and poor price
	for that object.
   - Object Database - as objects are searched for, they are added to a database and stored.
	once these items are stored, users can post prices they have paid for that object to
	help filter misleading eBay prices, as well as leave reviews for it.
   - User features where they can build an item watchlist, leave reviews on items, and share prices
	for items.
